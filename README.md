After getting into github I was able to browse around and get familiar with commands and the set up, I am looking forward to working in Github.I was able to set up my profile with my current interest.
The repository I created was a a little confusing at first. I seeked help from a tutor and was reminded to read the whole assignment before I begin working on the assignment. I was able to answere my own question once i read threw the assignment. I was easy and simple. I look forward to working with github.
The steps I took to clone the repository 
First, I clicked on the [+] Clone repository
Second, I enetered my username.github.io
Third, I chose the location on my computer (desktop folder) to add my file.
Fourth, then clicked Clone repository
